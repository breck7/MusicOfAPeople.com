? How do I make music for Music of a People?

* Email us with your public domain songs.
* If we love them we'll reply with a one time offer. We may even offer to pay for a few months so you can focus on doing your best work. We'll let you know either way.
* We don't believe in exclusive deals and since your files are public domain you can do whatever the fuck you want with them.
* In the future, we may help you put on concerts, sell the highest quality vinyl records and sell some merchandise and we'll take 28.3% and you keep the rest.
* We will not sell mp3s or use any kind of DRM â€” fans come first and no fans want that. We want to make money together in the real world. Digital is just for spreading the word about you and your music.
